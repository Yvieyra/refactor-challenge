# <Refactor Challenge>

## Description

The refactor challenge was to edit the code make the website more accessible and follow accessibility standards. In doing so, this also helps's with search engine optimization. 
I have replaced the HTML code to match HTML semantics and the CSS sheet to reflect those changes as well. This project was used to learn howto use HTML semantics in exchange of non semantics HTML without changing a website's functionality or appearance.
